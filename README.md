# Collaborative-filtering-based-recommendation-system-for-movies

Movie recommendation systems are a necessity for any movie streaming platform’s survival and success. There
are thousands of distractions to the daily movie watcher who can view what catches their eye or scroll through a
selection of other movies. As the number of titles increase day by day, it can be difficult for viewers to decide what they
would want to watch. Hence, in the perspective of a streaming service’s success, it is important to increase customer
engagement by identifying the customer’s wants and needs. In order to keep these customers from joining a competitor
streaming service, it is important that these platforms have a solid recommendation system that accurately predicts a
user’s interests.
There are several different approaches that can be used when building recommendation systems: Content-Based
Filtering, Collaborative Filtering, and Hybrid Models. Content-Based Filtering focuses on a user’s interest specifically
and recommends items that a user likes rather than what the majority likes. Collaborative Filtering is based on the
idea that a person likes things similar to what he or she has liked in the past and (or) people with similar interests.
Latent-Factor Models are a type of model-based Collaborative filtering method used to capture meaningful latent
connections between users and items inferred from rating patterns. Hybrid recommendation models can be used where
two or more recommendation methods are implemented to boost performance.
